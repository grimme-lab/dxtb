dxtb - Fully Differentiable Extended Tight-Binding
==================================================

This project provides a PyTorch-based fully differentiable implementation of the semi-empirical extended tight-binding (xTB) methods.

Introduction
------------

The xTB methods (GFNn-xTB) are a series of semi-empirical quantum chemical methods that provide a good balance between accuracy and computational cost.
For more details and the original Fortran implementation, check out the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb>`__ and the `documentation <https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/>`__.

With *dxtb*, we provide a re-implementation of the xTB methods in PyTorch, which allows for automatic differentiation and seamless integration into machine learning frameworks.

If you use *dxtb* in your research, please cite the following paper:
