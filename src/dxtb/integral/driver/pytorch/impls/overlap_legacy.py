    Calculate the full overlap matrix.

    The argument `uplo` has no effect. The legacy code always computes the
    upper triangular matrix and mirrors it to the lower part.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positions : Tensor
        Cartesian coordinates of all atoms in the system (nat, 3).
    bas : Basis
        Basis set information.
    ihelp : IndexHelper
        Helper class for indexing.
    uplo : Literal['n';, 'u', 'l'], optional
        Whether the matrix of unique shell pairs should be create as a
        triangular matrix (`l`: lower, `u`: upper) or full matrix (`n`).
        Defaults to `l` (lower triangular matrix).
    cutoff : Tensor | float | int | None, optional
        Real-space cutoff for integral calculation in Bohr. Defaults to
        `constants.defaults.INTCUTOFF`.

    Returns
