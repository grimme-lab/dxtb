Wrappers/Shortcuts for Integrals
================================

A simple collection for convenience functions of all integrals. In these
functions, defaults will be applied. Although (some) settings can be accessed
through keyword arguments, it is recommended to follow the interal integral
builds as used in the :class:`.Integrals` class for more direct control.

Note that there are several peculiarities for the multipole integrals:
- The multipole operators are centered on `(0, 0, 0)` (r0) and not on ket (rj),
  the latter being the default in `dxtb`.
- An overlap calculation is executed for the normalization of the multipole
  integral every time :func:`.dipole` or :func:`.quadrupole` are called.
- The quadrupole integral is not in its traceless representation.

Example
-------
>>> from dxtb.integral.wrappers import overlap, dipole, quadrupole
>>> from dxtb.param import GFN1_XTB as par
>>>
>>> numbers = torch.tensor([14, 1, 1, 1, 1])
>>> positions = torch.tensor([
     [+0.00000000000000, +0.00000000000000, +0.00000000000000],
     [+1.61768389755830, +1.61768389755830, -1.61768389755830],
     [-1.61768389755830, -1.61768389755830, -1.61768389755830],
     [+1.61768389755830, -1.61768389755830, +1.61768389755830],
     [-1.61768389755830, +1.61768389755830, +1.61768389755830],
 ])
>>>
>>> s = overlap(numbers, positions, par)
>>> print(s.shape)
torch.Size([17, 17])
>>> d = dipole(numbers, positions, par)
>>> print(d.shape)
torch.Size([3, 17, 17])
>>> q = quadrupole(numbers, positions, par)
>>> print(q.shape)
torch.Size([9, 17, 17])
