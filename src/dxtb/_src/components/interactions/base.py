    Base class for defining interactions with the charge density.

    Every charge-dependent energy contribution should inherit from this class
    as it conveniently handles the different resolutions (atom, shell, orbital)
    required for all subclasses. Depending on the contribution the user must
    implement a ``get_<atom/shell>_<potential/energy/gradient>`` method. The
    methods that are not implemented automatically evaluate to zero. As they
    are always called in the process of collecting the different resolutions,
    you must NOT implement them.

    .. warning::

        Never overwrite the ``get_potential``, ``get_energy`` and
        ``get_gradient`` methods in the subclass. These methods collect the
        respective variable for their (internally-handled) evaluation.

    Additionally, a ``get_cache`` method is required that should precalculate
    and store all charge-independent variables to avoid repeated calculations
    during the SCF.

    Note
    ----
    The nuclear gradient of the Mulliken charges essentially yields a
    derivative of the overlap integral. This is handled elsewhere and must
    not be implemented by the ``get_<atom/shell>_gradient`` methods.

    Example
    -------
    The third-order electrostatics class:`dxtb.components.ES3` of GFN1-xTB
    contain only atom-resolved parameters. Hence, it only implements
    ``get_atom_energy`` and ``get_atom_potential`` (besides the required
    ``get_cache`` method).
    Since there is not positional dependence (except for the charges, which is
    handled elsewhere) in the third-order electrostatics, no gradient method
    must be implemented.
