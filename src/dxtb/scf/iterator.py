"""
Self-consistent field iteration
===============================

Provides implementation of self consistent field iterations for the xTB
Hamiltonian. The iterations are not like in ab initio calculations expressed in
the density matrix and the derivative of the energy w.r.t. to the density
matrix, i.e. the Hamiltonian, but the Mulliken populations (or partial charges)
of the respective orbitals as well as the derivative of the energy w.r.t. to
those populations, i.e. the potential vector.

The implementation is based on the `xitorch <https://xitorch.readthedocs.io>`__
library, which appears to be abandoned and unmaintained at the time of writing,
but still provides a reasonably good implementation of the iterative solver
required for the self-consistent field iterations.
